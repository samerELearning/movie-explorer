# movie-explorer
This Angular project showcases a movie catalog with several enhanced features. It offers an intuitive interface to explore movies, view details, and manage favorites, leveraging Angular's capabilities.
## Features

### Movie Details Page
Clicking on a movie navigates to a detailed page showcasing information about the selected movie, including its title, release date, overview, poster in a larger size, and film cast details.

### Favorite List
Users can mark selected films as favorites using a heart icon. The application offers a menu option to display the user's favorite film list, which is stored in the browser's local storage.

### Featured Films
